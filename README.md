This code base contains the implementation for Quine-Mccluskey method for multi-valued logic (MVL).
The implementation is refined to allow only merging of adjacent minterms (not non-continuous ones) and an improved grouping is used for the same.

The code is used to minimize the context to mode mapping for the controller synthesis for complex embedded systems

The code is well documented with inline comments. A testcase generator is also released which can generate random testcases to be minimized using this algorithm.
